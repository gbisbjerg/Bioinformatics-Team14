Description: 

    This program takes a file with a mutated genome and a regular genome and outputs the ideal PAM sequence for CRISPR 


Instructions for how to run the program: 


1).  Make sure you have the following installed:

  1.) PamTrie
  2.) pandas
  3.) argparse 


2). To run: 
    
    * All files print the results to standard out (Not a .csv or .txt file)
    * The user will input the correct arguments below: 

    usage: pam_frequency.py [-h] --regular_file REGULAR_FILE --mutated_file MUTATED_FILE [--runtime]

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --regular_file REGULAR_FILE
                            Name of the file that has an unmutated genome string
    --mutated_file MUTATED_FILE
                            Name of that has a mutated genome string
    --runtime             Outputs runtime analysis for given genome sequence


    Example command: 
        python3   pam_frequency.py --regular_file sample_2k.txt --mutated_file sample_2k_mutation.txt


3). Output:

    a). There will an output with: 

        1.) The ideal PAM sequence 
        2.) Information about the ideal PAM

    Example: 

        Ideal PAM: 'NYN'
                Occurs 3 times in the sequence
                Is 1 neucleotide(s) away from the mutation

        Additional Information:
                Name: SpRY - low efficiency PAM
                BP: 20
                Sequence: NYN
                End: f
                Possibilities: [ACA, ACG, ACC, ACT, ATA, ATG, ATC, ATT, GCA, G...
